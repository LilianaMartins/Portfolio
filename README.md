# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio

For this project I am creating a personal CSS library which I'll then save to different files and import to my main CSS

I am creating a custom flex-box library which will make it easy to call flexbox classes using just html and importing my custom library

I am doing this as part of a personal exercise
